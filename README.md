## Self-learning snake
 
Key tasks:

- Formalization of the environment: definition of the state space,
action set and reward function

- Implementation of the Q-learning algorithm using the Q-table for agent control.

- Optimization of hyperparameters (learning rate,
discounting, Îµ-greedy strategy)

Files:

- snake0.py - main file
- qtable.npy - an array of data that the snake uses to know where to move
